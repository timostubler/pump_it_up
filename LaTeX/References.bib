	abstract = {Almost exclusively, lineshape functions used to model infrared (IR) absorption peaks are based on symmetric frequency distributions. However, in complex systems such as large biological macromolecules in aqueous solutions, the distribution of vibrational frequencies may in fact be asymmetric. In this communication, we show that asymmetry can be introduced to the standard symmetric Lorentzian and Gaussian lineshapes using a simple, easy to implement method. Our technique involves replacing the static width parameter of the symmetric profiles with a smoothly varying function that is wave number dependent. In this way, the width varies across the IR band resulting in an asymmetric peak. In our model, the width varies sigmoidally with wave number. As a demonstration, we fit experimental spectra of adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP).},

	doi = {10.1107/S1600577514004962},
	abstract = {The crystal lattice of single-crystal silicon gives rise to anisotropic elasticity. The stiffness and compliance coefficient matrix depend on crystal orientation and, consequently, Young's modulus, the shear modulus and Poisson's ratio as well. Computer codes (in Matlab and Python) have been developed to calculate these anisotropic elasticity parameters for a silicon crystal in any orientation. These codes facilitate the evaluation of these anisotropy effects in silicon for applications such as microelectronics, microelectromechanical systems and X-ray optics. For mechanically bent X-ray optics, it is shown that the silicon crystal orientation is an important factor which may significantly influence the optics design and manufacturing phase. Choosing the appropriate crystal orientation can both lead to improved performance whilst lowering mechanical bending stresses. The thermal deformation of the crystal depends on Poisson's ratio. For an isotropic constant Poisson's ratio, ν, the thermal deformation (RMS slope) is proportional to (1 + ν). For a cubic anisotropic material, the thermal deformation of the X-ray optics can be approximately simulated by using the average of ν 12 and ν 13 as an effective isotropic Poisson's ratio, where the direction 1 is normal to the optic surface, and the directions 2 and 3 are two normal orthogonal directions parallel to the optical surface. This average is independent of the direction in the optical surface (the crystal plane) for Si(100), Si(110) and Si(111). Using the effective isotropic Poisson's ratio for these orientations leads to an error in thermal deformation smaller than 5.5\%.},

In connection with this, the shifts and splittings of the triply degenerate k = 0 optical mode frequencies in crystals of the diamond structure in the presence of a static electric field or a strain are determined. It is shown that the shifts in frequencies are of second order in the electric field and are of first order in the strain. In both cases the frequency shifts can be expressed in terms of three parameters. Expressions for these parameters are obtained in terms of atomic force constants and derivatives of the electronic polarizability. The magnitudes and signs of the frequency shifts are estimated on the basis of a simple model of diamond-type crystals.},
